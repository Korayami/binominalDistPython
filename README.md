# Binominal Distribution Python App
## A simple application to find different values of Binominal Distribution and statistics

Features:
- Find Propability for a set value
- Find Propability for a range of values
- Find missing values for Binominal Distributions
  e.g.:
  - value ```k``` | ```k``` succeses in ```n``` tries
  - value ```n``` | amount of tries ```n``` for ```k``` hits
  - value ```p``` | possability ```p``` for getting a single ```k```
  - value ```P``` | possability for getting ```k``` succeses in ```n``` tries with a possability ```p``` of getting a single ```k```
